# ‚úÖ **Project Development Standards & AI Workflow Index**

This document defines the **core rules, best practices, and AI-assisted development prompts** for all projects. It is optimized for indexing in **Cursor AI** and serves as the **single source of truth** for code quality, documentation, and workflow automation.

---

## **1. Core Development Principles**

* ‚úÖ **Reuse existing functions and components** wherever possible.
* ‚úÖ Avoid **code redundancy, duplication, and hardcoding**.
* ‚úÖ Apply **DRY principles** and modular coding structure.
* ‚úÖ Implement **global form validation and submission rules** for all create/edit actions.
* ‚úÖ **All data tables must include complete CRUD functionality**:

  * **Create/Edit** ‚Üí Validates and updates database records.
  * **Delete** ‚Üí Requires **confirmation modal** and enforces **RLS/RBAC restrictions**.
* ‚úÖ **Business logic always takes precedence** over UI shortcuts.
* ‚úÖ **No modification of existing UI components** without explicit approval.

---

## **2. Documentation & System Plan**

* ‚úÖ **System Documentation** must be updated after:

  * Adding new features.
  * Fixing bugs or applying enhancements.
* ‚úÖ **API Documentation**:

  * Maintain **Swagger/OpenAPI specs** for all endpoints.
  * Auto-generate updates when routes or models change.
* ‚úÖ **User Guide & Role Permissions**:

  * Update instructions whenever features affect user workflows.

---

## **3. Feature Implementation Rules**

* ‚úÖ Use **existing reusable code** before creating new implementations.
* ‚úÖ Use **existing database access methods** before creating new database connections in Supabase.
* ‚úÖ Maintain **compatibility with existing business logic**.
* ‚úÖ Optimize for **clean, maintainable, and scalable code**.

---

## **4. Security & Permissions**

* ‚úÖ Never hardcode **API keys or credentials**.
* ‚úÖ Validate and sanitize **all user inputs**.
* ‚úÖ Enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for sensitive operations.

---

## **5. Version Control & CI/CD**

* ‚úÖ Branching Strategy:

  * **Feature Branch ‚Üí dev\_branch ‚Üí main\_branch**.
* ‚úÖ Merge only after:

  * Passing all tests.
  * Documentation updates complete.
* ‚úÖ **CI/CD must auto-trigger:**

  * API docs update.
  * System documentation generation.
  * Test execution before deployment.

---

## **6. UI/UX Consistency**

* ‚úÖ **Uniform Buttons Across the System**:
  Use the **design system‚Äôs button components** for all actions.
* ‚úÖ **Uniform System Loading Indicators**:
  Implement **consistent loading animations and skeleton screens** whenever:

  * Buttons are clicked.
  * Data is being fetched or saved.
* ‚úÖ Follow **design system tokens** for all new components.
* ‚úÖ Ensure **responsiveness and accessibility** across devices.

---

## **7. Error Handling & Debugging**

* ‚úÖ **Detailed Error Messages**:
  Provide **specific error details** (not generic messages) to ease debugging.
* ‚úÖ **Standard Error Handling Pattern**:

  * Catch exceptions globally.
  * Show **friendly user-facing messages** and **developer logs** in console.
* ‚úÖ **Error Logging**:
  All errors should be logged with **timestamp, API route, payload, and stack trace** for quick resolution.
* ‚úÖ **Knowledge Base of Previous Errors**:
  Maintain a **reference log** of past issues and how they were fixed for **reuse in future debugging**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Golden Rule**

> **Prioritize business logic, maintainability, and security above all shortcuts or temporary fixes.**

# ‚úÖ **Testing Scenarios**

| **Feature**         | **Test Case**                | **Expected Result**                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Create**          | Submit form with valid data  | Record is saved in DB                  |
|                     | Submit with invalid data     | Error message shown                    |
| **Read**            | Load table data              | All records display correctly          |
| **Update**          | Edit record and save         | Updated record persists in DB          |
|                     | Edit with invalid data       | Validation error shown                 |

# ‚úÖ **Automatic Documentation Strategy**

### **System Documentation**

* Use **AI tools or Docusaurus** to auto-generate documentation after commits.

### **API Documentation**

* Use **Swagger/OpenAPI** to:

  * Auto-generate endpoint documentation on every update.
  * Validate request/response models.

### **User Guide Updates**

* Whenever a feature changes the UI:

  * Update **screenshots, usage steps, and role permissions**.

### **Error Knowledge Base**

* Maintain a **centralized log of recurring errors** with:

  * **Description of error**
  * **Root cause**
  * **Solution applied**
  * **Date fixed**
  * **Related module**

# Pinned system prompt for Cursor ‚Äî **STOP AUTO-REVERTS**

**Role:** You are the Cursor AI working in **suggest-only** mode.

**Hard rules (do not break):**

1. **Never revert, regenerate, or overwrite** any file or line that‚Äôs already present in my working copy **unless I explicitly say ‚Äúrevert <file>‚Äù**.
2. Treat the **current filesystem** as the **single source of truth**. If your memory conflicts with what‚Äôs on disk, the disk wins‚Äîre-read the file instead of guessing.
3. **Do not auto-apply** changes. **Propose only minimal diffs** and wait for my confirmation before applying.
4. **Never run git commands** (`reset`, `checkout`, `stash`, `clean`, `pull`, etc.) or postinstall/codegen steps on your own. Ask first and show the exact commands you intend to run.
5. **Do not touch config & secrets** without explicit permission: `.env*`, `supabase/`, `vite.config.*`, `package.json`, lockfiles, CI, Docker, or project scripts.
6. **Do not create/rename/delete files** without confirming the exact paths.
7. Prefer **surgical edits** over full-file rewrites. Preserve formatting, CRLF/LF, imports order, comments, and file headers.
8. If a file is generated, **modify the template/source**, not the generated artifact‚Äîask me to locate the source if uncertain.
9. For React, **do not change hook order** or move hooks across conditionals. For routing, **do not change existing routes/redirects** unless I ask.
10. If you can‚Äôt complete an edit **without risking a revert or large rewrite**, stop and ask for permission.

**Edit format to use (mandatory):**
Return changes as **unified patches** only, using this exact format so I can review before applying:

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: <relative/path/to/file.ext>
@@
-<old line>
+<new line>
*** End Patch
```

* Use separate `*** Update File` blocks per file.
* If adding a file:

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: <relative/path/new-file.ext>
<file contents>
*** End Patch
```

* If deleting a file (only after I confirm):

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Delete File: <relative/path/to/file.ext>
*** End Patch
```

**When unsure:** ask a **yes/no** question first.
**When a generator is involved:** propose the exact change to the generator/template and show the minimal patch.

Acknowledge these rules with: **‚ÄúReady in suggest-only mode.‚Äù** Then wait for my request.

---

## Optional (quick settings you can do once in Cursor)

* Settings ‚Üí turn **off** any ‚Äúauto-apply‚Äù, ‚Äúauto-fix‚Äù, or ‚Äúapply changes automatically‚Äù options.
* If you use repo ‚ÄúRules/Guidelines‚Äù, paste this same block there so it‚Äôs always loaded.

---

Paste that at the top of your Cursor session (or into your Workspace/Project rules). It‚Äôll keep Cursor from auto-reverting or silently re-writing files and force it to propose small, reviewable patches only.
